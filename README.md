## Features

- üöÄ Pre-configured Docker setup
- üêç Python integration for custom nodes
- üåê Playwright browser automation support
- üîÑ Easy workflow management
- üîí Secure credential handling
- üê≥ Tomcat server for web applications

## Installation

```bash
docker pull tobecrazy/n8n-python:latest
docker-compose up -d
```

## Configuration

Environment variables can be set in the `docker-compose.yml` or `.env` file:

```
# Enable/disable runners (set to true to use)
N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true

# SQLite connection pool size
DB_SQLITE_POOL_SIZE=10

# Basic Auth
N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=admin
N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=password

# PostgreSQL (optional)
DB_TYPE=postgresdb
DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE=n8n_Database
DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST=db
DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT=5432
DB_POSTGRESDB_USER=n8n_user

## Playwright Browser Automation

This n8n setup includes Playwright for browser automation, with the following features:

- **System Dependencies**: The Docker image includes all necessary system dependencies for Playwright and Chromium.
- **Chromium Browser**: Uses the system's own Chromium browser for better performance and compatibility.
- **Setup Script**: A `playwright-setup.sh` script runs on container startup to configure the environment, ensuring Playwright can locate and use the system's Chromium instance.
- **Environment Variables**: The `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` is set to `0` to prevent Playwright from downloading its own browser binaries, and other variables are configured for seamless integration.
- **n8n Node Support**: Fully supports n8n's Playwright nodes for building browser-based automation workflows.

## Tomcat Server

This project also includes a complete Tomcat server setup with:
- OpenJDK 21 on Ubuntu 25.10
- Tomcat 9.0.108
- Docker container management script
- Volume mapping for webapps, logs, and configuration
- Health check monitoring
- Non-root user security

See [Tomcat/README.md](Tomcat/README.md) for detailed Tomcat setup and management instructions.

## MCP Server Configuration

This n8n setup includes built-in support for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. To configure MCP servers, set the following environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`:

```
MCP_BRAVE_API_KEY=your-brave-api-key
MCP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
MCP_SERPER_API_KEY=your-serper-key
MCP_WEATHER_API_KEY=your-weather-api-key
```

## Troubleshooting Docker Build Issues

If you encounter dependency conflicts during the Docker image build, especially related to `openssl-dev` on Alpine Linux, it's likely due to inconsistencies between Alpine's stable and `edge` repositories. The `Dockerfile` has been updated to address this by:

1.  Ensuring both `main` and `community` `edge` repositories are used.
2.  Performing `apk update` and `apk upgrade` to update existing packages.
3.  Explicitly installing `openssl` and `openssl-dev` early in the `apk add` command to prioritize their dependency resolution.

If you still face issues, ensure your Docker cache is cleared and try rebuilding with `docker-compose up --build --force-recreate`.
